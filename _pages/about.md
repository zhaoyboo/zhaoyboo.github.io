I am a first-year PhD student advised by [Prof. Alan (Zaoxing) Liu](https://zaoxing.github.io/) at [University of Maryland, College Park](https://umd.edu/). My research interests are broadly in networked systems and machine learning systems. 

I received my bachelor degree for Computer Science from [Shanghaitech University](http://shanghaitech.edu.cn/eng/) in 2023.
